| Project       | Description          |
| -------- |:-------:|
| [ElektoR](https://github.com/vtisza/Elektor)| *[Hungarian]* Neat **Shiny/R** webapp to simulate how the modification of certain election rules would have influenced tbe result of the Hungarian parliamentary elections in 2014. (Antecedent: Hungarian election law was severly modified in 2013) As a spin-off of the project I am working on an R package implementing different vote-to-mandate allocation algorithms. <br><br>For the deployed version of the app [click here](https://elektor.shinyapps.io/Valasztas/).  |
| What's cooking      | **Shiny/R** application based on the "What's cooking?" Kaggle machine learning challange. User can input ingredients from a recepie and the app will predict the cuisine. It will also represent in a wordcloud the main ingredients of the predicted cuisine. After preprocessing ingredients are represented as a TF-IDF vector and a random forest was trained for the predictive algorithm. <br><br>For the deployed version of the app [click here](https://cooking.shinyapps.io/Predictor/).  |
| [Did He Tweet?](https://github.com/simplton/didHeTweet)    | A simple **VueJS** page served by **Flask/Python API** to show if Donald Trump tweeted lately. Also displays a wordcloud based on the latest tweets and some basic statistics. <br><br>A joint project with [@Formatted](https://github.com/Formatted/) to practice remote AGILE cooperation (@Formatted is based in US).  <br><br>[Click here](https://didhetweet.herokuapp.com/) for the app.   |
| [Milan/Budapest Rental](https://github.com/vtisza/MilanRentalSpyder) | A **Scrapy/Python** webspyder collects rental and sale advertisments from a major Italian/Hungarian real estate site. Raw data is processed in **Pandas/Python** to better understand the housing market and provide investment insights. Result are represented in a single page app using **CrossfilterJS**. <br><br> [Click here](https://vtisza.github.io/MilanRentalSpyder/BudapestVisual/) for the Budapest ([Hungarian]) and [here](https://vtisza.github.io/MilanRentalSpyder/MilanVisual/) for the Milan results.   |
| [Portfolinfo](ttps://github.com/vtisza/portfolinfo) | Creating effective investment portfolios. Financial analysis in Python. <br><br>Click [here](https://github.com/vtisza/portfolinfo/blob/master/portfolio_returns.ipynb) for the corresponding notebook.      |
| [Book recommender](https://github.com/vtisza/book_recommendation) | *[Hungarian]* Scraping data from a social network for books. Implementing several collaborative filtering solution to create a recommender system using **Pandas/Numpy/Scipy/Python**. <br><br>Stay tuned for the notebook summarizing results.     |
